To Do:
- create frontend layout
    - start page (render create meal prep + button)
    - question: create separate screens or simply change on-screen components as user clicks? 
    - idea: one screen for 'create' flow, one screen for final plan/each plan, one screen for login, one screen for all plans, sign in, sign up

- setup backend
    - create db
    - create schemas for plans, recipes
    - after working on login/auth, create schema for users
    - create express server, connect to app start
